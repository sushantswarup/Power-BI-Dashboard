Comparative Analysis: Assesses engagement rates for tweets posted during business hours.
Dual-Axis Chart: Depicts media views and engagements over time.
Pie Chart: Displays the distribution of different types of clicks.
The dashboard is interactive, offering features like filters and drill-downs to enhance data exploration.





The dashboard provides interactive features, such as filters and drill-downs, to facilitate data exploration.
